- 👋 Hi, I’m @benghguthrie!
- 👀 I’m interested in learning how to use R and other coding languages to access sequencing data (and other big data) to lead a lab at a primarily undergraduate institution.
- 🌱 I’m currently researching the influence of the microbiome on the pharmacology of drugs and other xenobiotics. You might think that bacteria wouldn't respond to human-targeted drugs, but they do!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on code that is useful for biochemists and microbiologists.
- 📫 How to reach me: Visit my website benghguthrie.com
